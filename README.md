My Euler Project Solutions

These are my solutions to project euler problems.  I am mostly putting them here to help me get into the habbit of using github.  (Also, it occours to me that potential employeers might find it usefull to see how I solve these)

However, if you have not already solved the problem, I beg you DO NOT LOOK AT THE SOLUTION.  The whole point of project euler is to have fun trying to solve these problems as efficently as possible.  Looking at my answer when you have not solved it yet is pretty much cheating, and that is no fun.

If you don't have an account on Project Euler, I reccomend you create one.  It is a really fun site.
